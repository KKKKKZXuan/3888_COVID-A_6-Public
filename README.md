### Week 8 catch-up notes

*Apr 25* by *Ben Shade*

Hey CovidA6,

Just a few notes from yesterday's meeting:

* If I remember correctly, your target audience at this point was 'people vulnerable to Covid'. Have a think about how exactly you'll define this target audience, and possibly consider narrowing it down a bit  
如果我没记错的话，您此时的目标受众是“易感染 Covid 的人”。 考虑一下您将如何准确定义此目标受众，并可能考虑将其缩小一点

* Start thinking about how you might combine the COVID data with other datasets  
开始思考如何将 COVID 数据与其他数据集结合起来

It'd be great if you could provide a bit of an update of your progress in a few days time!  
如果您能在几天内提供一些有关您的进度的更新，那就太好了！

Cheers,

The teaching team

@Prof_Jean_Yang

Dear CovidA6,

Will be good if you response and provide some update to the teaching team's notes and let us know which students contributes to which aspect of the work.  A draft Figure 1 showing the over all workflow will be good to demonstrate at this stage.  
如果您回复并提供一些更新教学团队的笔记，并让我们知道哪些学生对工作的哪个方面做出了贡献，那就太好了。 显示整个工作流程的草稿图 1 将在此阶段很好地展示。
